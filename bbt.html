      <h1 class="wbbt_heading">What is the Big Bang Theory?</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        The Big Bang Theory explains how the universe began. It suggests that
        about 13.8 billion years ago, the universe started as a tiny, super-hot,
        and super-dense point.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt2_heading">How Did It Happen?</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        Suddenly, this point expanded very quickly, like a giant explosion. This
        expansion created space, time, and everything in the universe.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt3_heading">Formation of Stars and Galaxies</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        As the universe grew, it began to cool down. Over billions of years, stars, planets, and galaxies formed.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt4_heading">Evidence for the Big Bang</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        Scientists have found evidence, such as :
      </p>
      <ul class="wbbt_ul">
        <li class="wbbt_li">1. Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation: Leftover heat from the Big Bang.</li>
        <li class="wbbt_li">2. Movement of Galaxies: Galaxies are moving away from each other, showing the universe is still expanding.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1 class="wbbt5_heading">Why is it Important?</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        The Big Bang is not just an explosion. It marks the beginning of everything we see today. It helps us understand how the universe works and continues to grow.
