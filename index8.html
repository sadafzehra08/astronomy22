        <p class="para1">
            Neptune was discovered on September 23, 1846 by Johann Galle, based on predictions by mathematicians Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams. It was the first planet located through mathematical calculations rather than direct observation.

                <li class="l1">Methane gives Neptune its deep blue color. The atmosphere is dynamic, with strong winds and massive storms, including the Great Dark Spot, similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</li>
