      <h1 class="wbbt_heading">Formation of Earth</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        About 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed from a cloud of gas and dust
        around the Sun. Gravity pulled the materials together to create a hot,
        molten planet.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt2_heading">Cooling and Formation of Crust</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        As Earth cooled, a solid crust formed on its surface. Volcanic activity
        released gases, creating the early atmosphere.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt3_heading">Formation of Oceans</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        Water vapor in the atmosphere condensed, leading to rainfall that filled
        the low areas of the crust, forming the first oceans.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt4_heading">Beginning of Life</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        About 3.5 billion years ago, simple life forms, like bacteria, appeared
        in the oceans. These organisms released oxygen through photosynthesis,
        slowly changing the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt5_heading">Development of Complex Life</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        Over millions of years, life evolved into more complex forms, including
        plants, animals, and eventually humans. Continents also shifted and
        changed shape due to plate tectonics.
      </p>
      <h1 class="wbbt5_heading">Present Day Earth</h1>
      <p class="wbbt_para">
        Today, Earth is a planet full of diverse life. It continues to evolve with natural changes and human impact.
